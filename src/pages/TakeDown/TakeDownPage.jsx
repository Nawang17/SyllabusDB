      <p>
        SyllabusDB is a student-run platform created to help others make smarter
        course decisions. We respect the rights of professors and universities
        and will promptly remove any syllabus or material upon request.

      </p>

      <h2>Student Uploads</h2>
      <p>
        SyllabusDB relies on student contributions. If you upload a syllabus, we
        assume it is something you received while taking the class and want to
        share to help others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please do not upload:
        <ul>
          <li>Exams, quizzes, or assignments</li>
          <li>Solution manuals or answer keys</li>
          <li>
            Publisher-owned content like textbook slides or paid resources
          </li>
          <li>Anything private, confidential, or copyrighted</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Fair Use Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        We believe sharing syllabi to help with course planning qualifies as
        fair use, especially when used non-commercially and in limited scope.
        However, we always cooperate with takedown requests.
